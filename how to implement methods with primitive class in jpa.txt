So, we usually perform some user defined tasks in jpa
like
findByEmailAndPassword(String email, String pass) -> it returns the user with matching email and password.

That's quite because they are just the user class variables but what if we have something like this

	class user{
		String name;
		String pass;
		Address address;
	}

	classcAddress{
		String city
		String street
		String zipCode;
	}

what if i want all the users who are from a particular city? how do we do that?

well it simple

user from particular city
	List<User> findByAddressCity(String city); // returns all the users form the particular city

List<User> findByAddressStreet(String street// returns all the users form the particular street

List<User> findByAddressZipCode(String zipCode// returns all the users form the particular zipCode
